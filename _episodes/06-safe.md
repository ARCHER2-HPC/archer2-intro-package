SAFE is a web-based tool developed by EPCC that allows you to:

* Manage your ARCHER2 account
* Record research outputs linked to your use of ARCHER2
* Look at your historical use of ARCHER2 service
* (If you are a project leader/manager.) Manage your project's resources on ARCHER2

You should already have used SAFE to apply for your ARCHER2 user account for this course. In
this section we will look at how you use SAFE for common tasks associated with your use of
ARCHER2.

More information on using SAFE can be found in
[the SAFE User Guide](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/documentation/safe-guide/)

## Account management

You will have at least two accounts associated with your use of ARCHER2: an account on the
SAFE web tool and ARCHER2 login (sometimes called *machine*) accounts.

> ## Multiple login accounts
> You can have multiple ARCHER2 login accounts associated with a single SAFE account. Many
> users will also have access to the EPSRC Tier-2 HPC resources and login accounts for those
> systems will often also be linked to our SAFE account. So you can actually have multiple
> login accounts on multiple services associated with a single SAFE account!

We will not document the full use of SAFE here but will mention a few of the most useful
options with managing your different accounts.

### Your SAFE account

Your SAFE account is used to allow you to manage your login accounts and resources, set
contact details and preferences, record research outputs associated with your use of the
service and report on your historical use of the service. We cover these topics in more
detail below but first we will look at:

* Using your institution's single sign on (SSO) to access SAFE
* Changing your e-mail notification preferences

### Your ARCHER2 login account(s)

* Resetting your password
* Adding access to licensed software
* Viewing resources available

## Recording research outputs

## Reporting on your use of the service
